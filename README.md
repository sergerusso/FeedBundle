Simple and beautiful cross-platform rss news reader.


## How to build
Just [package it](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Package%20and%20Distribute/#prepare-nwjs). It's a web app, but you need nwjs.io to deal with [same-origin policy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)

Support for PHP/Node/Ruby proxy may be added in the future, so it can also be run on a web server.
